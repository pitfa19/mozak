# Changelog

User-visible changes, newest first. Releases are git tags `vX.Y.Z` on `main`; `mozak upgrade` installs the newest one.

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- `mozak doctor` checks `mozak-mcp` with a real handshake (0.2.0 reported a false "did not answer" note) and fails the installation check when it does not answer.
- The MCP server reports its real version in the handshake instead of `0.0.0`.
- `mozak doctor` on a fresh setup: an MCP setting that names the standard `~/.local/bin/mozak-mcp` wrapper before it exists now points at `mozak doctor --fix` instead of asking you to edit the setting, its inventory is checked in the same run, and scopes without `MOZAK.json` get a "pull your notes or run scope init" hint.

## 0.2.0 (2026-10-19)

First tagged release.

### Added

- `mozak upgrade` moves an installation to the newest tagged release. It builds the tag from the checkout the installation came from, keeps the old installation as `PREFIX.previous-<version>`, puts it back if anything fails, and with `--vault PATH` updates the Obsidian plugin in that vault. `--check` only reports.
- `mozak doctor` checks Node, the installation, `PATH`, agent skill links, MCP config, the inventory and the Obsidian plugin, and prints the exact fix for each problem. `--fix` makes skill links and `~/.local/bin` wrappers and refreshes outdated plugin copies. It never edits MCP config, the inventory or plans.
- `mozak --version`. `--help` shows the version on its first line.
- Update notice: `mozak scopes` and the Obsidian sidebar mention a newer release. The check reads GitHub's public tag list at most once a day, in the background, and `MOZAK_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` turns it off.
- Plans for public repos can live in a private vault folder (`"plans": "<folder>"` on a remote inventory entry), and writes to plans inside a public repo are refused.
- Read commands run inside a clone of an inventoried repo find their scope from the git origin, so `--scope` can be left out.
- Obsidian sidebar: roadmap, plan navigation into `MOZAK.md`, public or private badge on repo scopes.

### Changed

- Plan writes are crash safe: each file is flushed to disk before it replaces the old one, and the folder is flushed after. A crash leaves the old or the new state, never a broken file. `check` reports leftover temp files, and the next write removes them.
- `installation.json` records the source checkout (`source`), used by `mozak upgrade`.

## 0.1.0

Initial local release: scopes, plans, owner approvals, evidence, the CLI, the MCP server, the agent skill and the Obsidian plugin.
